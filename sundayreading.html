                                <p class="mbr-text py-5 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>First Reading<br></strong>[Wisdom 12:13,16-19]<br><strong><em>You will grant repentance after sin<br></em></strong><br>There is no god, other than you, who cares for every thing,<br>to whom you might have to prove that you never judged unjustly.<br>Your justice has its source in strength,<br>your sovereignty over all makes you lenient to all.<br>You show your strength when your sovereign power is questioned<br>and you expose the insolence of those who know it;<br>but, disposing of such strength, you are mild in judgement,<br>you govern us with great lenience,<br>for you have only to will, and your power is there.<br>By acting thus you have taught a lesson to your people<br>how the virtuous man must be kindly to his fellow men,<br>and you have given your sons the good hope<br>that after sin you will grant repentance.<br><br>**********<br><strong>Second reading</strong><br>[Romans 8:26-27]<br><strong><em>The Spirit himself expresses our plea in a way that could never be put into words</em></strong><br><br>The Spirit comes to help us in our weakness. For when we cannot choose words in order to pray properly, the Spirit himself expresses our plea in a way that could never be put into words, and God who knows everything in our hearts knows perfectly well what he means, and that the pleas of the saints expressed by the Spirit are according to the mind of God.<br><br>**********<br><strong>Gospel</strong><br>[Matthew 13:24-43]<br><strong><em>Let them both grow till the harvest</em></strong><br><br>Jesus put another parable before the crowds: ‘The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field. While everybody was asleep his enemy came, sowed darnel all among the wheat, and made off. When the new wheat sprouted and ripened, the darnel appeared as well. The owner’s servants went to him and said, “Sir, was it not good seed that you sowed in your field? If so, where does the darnel come from?” “Some enemy has done this” he answered. And the servants said, “Do you want us to go and weed it out?” But he said, “No, because when you weed out the darnel you might pull up the wheat with it. Let them both grow till the harvest; and at harvest time I shall say to the reapers: First collect the darnel and tie it in bundles to be burnt, then gather the wheat into my barn.”’<br>  He put another parable before them: ‘The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field. It is the smallest of all the seeds, but when it has grown it is the biggest shrub of all and becomes a tree so that the birds of the air come and shelter in its branches.’<br>  He told them another parable: ‘The kingdom of heaven is like the yeast a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour till it was leavened all through.’<br>  In all this Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables; indeed, he would never speak to them except in parables. This was to fulfil the prophecy:<br>I will speak to you in parables<br>and expound things hidden since the foundation of the world.<br>Then, leaving the crowds, he went to the house; and his disciples came to him and said, ‘Explain the parable about the darnel in the field to us.’ He said in reply, ‘The sower of the good seed is the Son of Man. The field is the world; the good seed is the subjects of the kingdom; the darnel, the subjects of the evil one; the enemy who sowed them, the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; the reapers are the angels. Well then, just as the darnel is gathered up and burnt in the fire, so it will be at the end of time. The Son of Man will send his angels and they will gather out of his kingdom all things that provoke offences and all who do evil, and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth. Then the virtuous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Listen, anyone who has ears!’<br></p>
